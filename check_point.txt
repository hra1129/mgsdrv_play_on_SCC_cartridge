1. MGSDRV.COM only works with RAM.

   Therefore, the MGSDRV itself needs to be copied to page2 RAM for use.

2. MGSDRV does not switch the SCC bank2 (8000h-9FFFh) to the SCC Register Bank in the H.TIMI routine. 
   The MGSDRV operates on the assumption that it is always the SCC Register Bank.
3. MGSDRV operates on the assumption that the song data is in the 4000h-5FFFh or 8000h-BFFFh range.
4. MGSDRV does not assume a case where MGS data and SCC sound source exist in the same slot.
5. MGSDRV assumes that the MGS data and the SCC sound source are always in different slots.

   Therefore, MGS data must also be copied to another slot for use.
